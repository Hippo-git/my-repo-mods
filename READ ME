REPO Homebrew Mods - Installation Guide
This repository contains custom, verified mods for our REPO sessions. Following these steps ensures your game is synced with the host and prevents crashes.

Quick Install (3 Steps)
Download the Mods: Click the green < > Code button at the top of this page and select Download ZIP.

Extract the Files: Open your Downloads folder, right-click the homebrew-repo-mods-main.zip, and select Extract All.

Run the Installer: Open the extracted folder and double-click install_mod.bat.

Using the Installer Menu
When the window opens, you will see three options:

Option 1 (Install/Update): This is the "Magic Button." It will automatically remove any old/conflicting versions of these mods and install the latest versions into a dedicated homebrew folder.

Option 2 (Uninstall): Use this if you want to wipe all homebrew mods and return your game to a standard state.

Option 3 (Exit): Closes the installer.

Troubleshooting
"Windows Protected Your PC": Because this is a custom .bat file, Windows might show a blue warning. Click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway."

File Not Found: Ensure the .bat file is in the same folder as the Boombox-Smuggler and Teammate_Map_Icons folders when you run it.
